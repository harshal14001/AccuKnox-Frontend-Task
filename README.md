## Customizable-Security-Widget-Grid

A highly interactive, data-driven Security dashboard application built with React.js. This project demonstrates dynamic UI rendering based on JSON data, state management for widget customization, and data visualization using Recharts.
The application simulates a CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform) interface, featuring categories for CSPM, CWPP, and Image Registry scans.


### 🚀 Key Features

- Dynamic Rendering: All widgets and categories are rendered dynamically from a structured JSON file, allowing for easy scalability.
- Add Widgets: A slide-out drawer (Sidebar) allows users to enable/disable specific widgets per category.
- Remove Widgets: Users can remove widgets directly from the dashboard view.
- Real-time Search: A global search bar filters widgets across all categories instantly.
- Data Visualization: Integrated Recharts to render interactive Pie Charts and Line Graphs.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive grid layout that adapts from 3 columns to 1 column based on screen size.
- State Management: Utilizes React Hooks (useState) to manage local state for widget visibility, search queries, and modal toggle
